# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
# But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For multiples of
# both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

# Hint: % (modulo) tells you what's left over when you divide one number by another
# ex. number % 3 == 0
